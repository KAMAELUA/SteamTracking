					<div class="person_content">Michael Abrash was ABD (All But Dissertation) in the PhD program in Energy Management and Policy at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 when he got his first microcomputer – a Vector Graphics VIP CP/M machine with 56K and 160x72 graphics – and he’s still ABD. (His mother stopped giving him a hard time about not getting his PhD sometime in the mid-1990’s, right around his first meeting with Bill Gates.) He did some of the earliest arcade-style games for the IBM PC (Space Strike, Cosmic Crusader, and Big Top, if you’re a trivia buff – and yes, they were sold in plastic baggies). After he discovered the hard way that the PC didn’t actually have a game market yet, he worked at a series of hardware and software graphics companies, writing several books (including Zen of Assembly Language) and magazine columns (remember them?) on performance and graphics (most notably for Dr. Dobb’s Journal) along the way. In 1992 he somehow ended up as the graphics lead for the first two versions of Windows NT, then in 1995 he went to Id and worked alongside John Carmack to write Quake. After that he worked on both versions of Xbox, cowrote a software renderer, and worked on Intel’s Larrabee project before coming to Valve.

					<div class="person_content"> Mike has a B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology from Yale and a PhD in Psychology from the University of Illinois. His job 

description is vague, but he thinks it probably has something to do with applying both psychological knowledge and methodologies to game design. Essentially this means he gets to play with data, perform 

research, and act as an in-house consultant of sorts. He is really happy that you took the time to read his paragraph.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Matthew loved to play video games as a child. His parents warned him that playing games wasn't going to get him a job in the future. After graduating from the University of Washington in 2010, he proved them wrong by landing a job at Valve. As part of Valve’s Steam Support Team, Matthew helps support our Korean community and localizing efforts, making thousands of Korean Steam users believe we actually have offices in Korea. Matthew also uses his Photoshop skills to help make sure advertisements for sales and promotions get properly translated and presented to Steam users in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, and German - just to name a few. In his spare time he enjoys playing soccer and any first-person shooter game he can get his hands on.</div>

Then, in 1993, he was introduced to CGI at Pixar – and he really LIKED IT. For the next 12 years, Mike worked at the Walt Disney Animation Studios on such projects as <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>, <i>Meet the Robinsons</i>, and <i>Bolt</i>.

					<div class="person_content">Another Fort Walton Beach, Florida native, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 1994 and headed for California and 3Dfx Interactive. His responsibilities there included developer support, porting products to hardware, sample code, simple demos, and ultimately working with the 3Dfx developer relations team to manage the engineering game porting effort. Charlie left 3Dfx after two years and, with his college friend Gary McTaggart, created the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Not long after joining Ritual, Charlie and Gary left to start their own company. Not long after that, Valve made Charlie (and Gary) an offer "they couldn't refuse."

Like most software engineers at the time, he decided to join an Internet startup and become a millionaire before turning 30. When that didn’t happen, and after the Internet bubble burst, he decided to forget all that web-based, e-commerce stuff and pursue his real dream: making video games. He joined Midway Games West (formerly, the original Atari). That studio shut down a few months later, so Tom moved on to Maxis where he worked on titles such as <i>Darkspore</i>, <i>Spore</i>, and <i>The Sims 2</i> (and many of its expansion packs). Since joining Valve in 2010, Tom has worked on <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Portal 2</i>, and small parts of Steam.</div>

Tobin joined Valve in 2008 and is blown away every day that, in addition to doing audio production on some of the coolest projects in the whole wide world, he’s allowed to tinker with the audio calls in the game code, and encouraged to learn more about that side of the process every day. </div>

					<div class="person_content">Erik began his career as a shoe salesman and moved up to selling used cars. When he decided that the car business wasn't for him either, he took a job in Sierra Online’s QA department. As one of Sierra's <i>Half-Life</i> testers, Erik spent a lot of time at Valve and we eventually offered him a job as shipping manager. Erik is now one of Valve’s business development authorities.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Kris seems to collect careers like some people collect Pokémon.  Before joining Valve - and the games industry - in 2008, he worked as a theatrical lighting and sound designer, radio producer and station automation programmer, farm news reporter, professional film critic, and TV editor. At Valve, he started out in Steam support, using his eyes (and ears) to help find and fix bugs across several Valve titles. Lately, he's been doing level and puzzle design for ongoing <i>Portal 2</i> development. On the side, Kris enjoys hiking, and volunteering with the Seattle Humane Society.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Emily ended up at Valve after a design recruiter said “it’s really too bad you weren’t interested in Valve.” What?! Fast forward two years and she’s currently working on making it easier for gamers to share the best parts of their favorite games on the Steam Community. Prior to Valve, Emily worked at Xbox, at a mobile, local, social networking start up (try saying that in an interview!), and at Pioneer Studios.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Having escaped (or been let loose?) from a secret bio-research lab in Siberia, Iikka started to design and program games at an early age. However, it wasn't until he began to create levels and mods for <i>Doom</i> and <i>Quake</i> that he became known to the world. In 1988, he left the pack of wolves that raised him for a job at ION Storm in Dallas, Texas. A few years and adventures later, he found himself at Valve. That was 2001. He hasn't had the urge to bite anybody since.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Dave joined Valve in 2005, fresh from the DigiPen Institute of Technology, where he helped create the mind-bending student project (and <i>Portal</i> precursor) <i>Narbacular Drop</i>. His primary contributions to <i>Portal</i> and <i>Portal 2</i> involved developing the graphics and physics systems that make the games’ unique discontinuous spaces work seamlessly in a 3D environment. With the addition of multiplayer in </i>Portal 2</i>, Dave then made those spatial discontinuities work with nonlinear prediction. Dave has also contributed to <i>Left 4 Dead</i> games and Xbox360 support for the Source engine. He is known within the company for his ability to quickly find new exploits in game mechanics.</div>
