					<div class="person_content">Michael Abrash was ABD (All But Dissertation) in the PhD program in Energy Management and Policy at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 when he got his first microcomputer – a Vector Graphics VIP CP/M machine with 56K and 160x72 graphics – and he’s still ABD. (His mother stopped giving him a hard time about not getting his PhD sometime in the mid-1990’s, right around his first meeting with Bill Gates.) He did some of the earliest arcade-style games for the IBM PC (Space Strike, Cosmic Crusader, and Big Top, if you’re a trivia buff – and yes, they were sold in plastic baggies). After he discovered the hard way that the PC didn’t actually have a game market yet, he worked at a series of hardware and software graphics companies, writing several books (including Zen of Assembly Language) and magazine columns (remember them?) on performance and graphics (most notably for Dr. Dobb’s Journal) along the way. In 1992 he somehow ended up as the graphics lead for the first two versions of Windows NT, then in 1995 he went to Id and worked alongside John Carmack to write Quake. After that he worked on both versions of Xbox, cowrote a software renderer, and worked on Intel’s Larrabee project before coming to Valve.

					<div class="person_content"> Mike has a B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology from Yale and a PhD in Psychology from the University of Illinois. His job 

description is vague, but he thinks it probably has something to do with applying both psychological knowledge and methodologies to game design. Essentially this means he gets to play with data, perform 

research, and act as an in-house consultant of sorts. He is really happy that you took the time to read his paragraph.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Matthew loved to play video games as a child. His parents warned him that playing games wasn't going to get him a job in the future. After graduating from the University of Washington in 2010, he proved them wrong by landing a job at Valve. As part of Valve’s Steam Support Team, Matthew helps support our Korean community and localizing efforts, making thousands of Korean Steam users believe we actually have offices in Korea. Matthew also uses his Photoshop skills to help make sure advertisements for sales and promotions get properly translated and presented to Steam users in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, and German - just to name a few. In his spare time he enjoys playing soccer and any first-person shooter game he can get his hands on.</div>

Then, in 1993, he was introduced to CGI at Pixar – and he really LIKED IT. For the next 12 years, Mike worked at the Walt Disney Animation Studios on such projects as <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>, <i>Meet the Robinsons</i>, and <i>Bolt</i>.

					<div class="person_content">Another Fort Walton Beach, Florida native, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 1994 and headed for California and 3Dfx Interactive. His responsibilities there included developer support, porting products to hardware, sample code, simple demos, and ultimately working with the 3Dfx developer relations team to manage the engineering game porting effort. Charlie left 3Dfx after two years and, with his college friend Gary McTaggart, created the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Not long after joining Ritual, Charlie and Gary left to start their own company. Not long after that, Valve made Charlie (and Gary) an offer "they couldn't refuse."

												<span>Tom Bui</span>
																	</div>
				
					<div class="person_content">Tom graduated from the University of California-Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Like most software engineers at the time, he decided to join an Internet startup and become a millionaire before turning 30. When that didn’t happen, and after the Internet bubble burst, he decided to forget all that web-based, e-commerce stuff and pursue his real dream: making video games. He joined Midway Games West (formerly, the original Atari). That studio shut down a few months later, so Tom moved on to Maxis where he worked on titles such as <i>Darkspore</i>, <i>Spore</i>, and <i>The Sims 2</i> (and many of its expansion packs). Since joining Valve in 2010, Tom has worked on <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Portal 2</i>, and small parts of Steam.</div>

												<span>Tobin Buttram</span>
																	</div>
				
					<div class="person_content">As a music major, Tobin fully expected to have a career in food service. Instead, he spent most of his twenties touring and recording with Robert Fripp and The League of Crafty Guitarists, which led, somehow, to Microsoft in 1996, where he worked on Interactive Music Architecture (DirectMusic) and then as an Audio Director at Microsoft Game Studios, primarily with FASA. Tobin joined Valve in 2008 and is blown away every day that, in addition to doing audio production on some of the coolest projects in the whole wide world, he’s allowed to tinker with the audio calls in the game code, and encouraged to learn more about that side of the process every day. </div>

					<div class="person_content">Chris spent his college years working on Quest, a <i>Quake</i> level editor. His first real job was at the Massachusetts-based Looking Glass Studios where he worked on sound and physics for <i>Thief</i>. (His <i>Thief</i>  handiwork included the revolutionary and tragically forgotten "sphere hat" primitive.) After a few sweaty years in Texas working on the <i>Deus Ex</i> sequel for Ion Storm Austin, Chris joined Valve. He still enjoys being able to step out of doors without bursting into flame.  </div>

					<div class="person_content">Dario started designing levels for <i>Doom</i> while he was studying economics at the University of Oxford in England. After building "Final Doom: The Plutonia Experiment" with his brother, he was invited to Valve where he discovered that it was actually possible to have a career in games. Upon graduating from Oxford in 1996, he decided that the finance world would just have to wait. After all these years in the U.S., Dario still stubbornly refuses to give up his accent, and happily endures being the subject of British jokes on a daily basis.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Matt grew up in Nottingham in the UK. He broke into videogames 14 years ago when he started working at a British shop called Core Design on a new game called <i>Tomb Raider</i>. Remember that one? Many sequels later he moved to Canada where he worked at Bioware (on <i>Mass Effect</i>) and then at Blizzard/Activision in Vancouver. When Matt joined Valve in 2008 he got straight to work crafting characters for <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i>. By adding a simple lacey undergarment, he managed to help make the Spitter even grosser than was previously thought possible. If he ever offers to show you his reference images, just walk away.</div>
